# mu

The best music player in the world

## Features

- Download music from Spotify, Soundcloud, and Soulseek
- Auto-generate playlists from genres, moods, or any other tags
- Self-hostable: stream your music anywhere

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to run with Docker:

```bash
  pnpm docker
```

## State of the Project

The player is very much in a usable state - I use it personally as my daily driver. However, the project is very much still in the "anything can break at any time" stage. You're free (and encouraged!) to try it out but I would not completely migrate your entire music collection into it until things stabilize.
