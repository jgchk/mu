# mu

The best music player in the world

## Features

- Download music from Spotify, Soundcloud, and Soulseek
- Auto-generate playlists from genres, moods, or any other tags
- Self-hostable: stream your music anywhere

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to run with Docker:

```bash
  pnpm docker
```

## State of the Project

The player is very much in a usable state - I use it personally as my daily driver. However, the project is very much in an "anything can break at any time" state. You're free (and encouraged!) to try out the project but I would not completely swap your entire music collection to it until things stabilize.
